adds a new enchant to the game, called Vertigo,
its got 3 lvls, each adding 60 ticks (3sec) of wallrunning time,
thats also what it does - allows you to wallrun,
can be obtained from an end city (5% chance to be in any chest, lvls 1-3),
isnt mutually exclusive with anything,

!!!IMPORTANT!!! THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (VertigoRP) (requires either Optifine or Entity Texture/Model Features)
